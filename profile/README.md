## Why

It's really hard to find software with good design & animations on desktop. It's almost like desktop app developers don't have faith in adding animations to their UI. Other music players, which look kind-of good don't work properly, refuse to support an audio format, read tags incorrectly, don't have my favorite feature or simply use [electron.js](https://electronjs.org).

Harmonoid very strictly implements [Material Design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28951144/187515841-265b2f6e-4ee3-4db5-b06d-0f7f5d684da9.webm) to be a consistent, cohesive & modern music player for all platforms.

There are no inconsistent paddings, spacings or weird alignments to make me feel uncomfortable. It's built with care & proper time is given to everything. Learn more about the project on [official website](https://harmonoid.com/) [until I can afford this domain].
